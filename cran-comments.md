## Resubmission

This is a resubmission to address the previously received comments. In this version I have:

-   Added <https://www.apra.gov.au/> to the package description, following the requested form.

-   Updated all exported functions documentation to use \\donttest{} instead of \\dontrun{}

-   Introduced download_apra() as a new exported function. This should prove a useful function for users whilst also supporting better examples for the read_x_local() type functions.
