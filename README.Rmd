The R package `readapra` provides a series of function to easily scrape data from the [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA)](https://www.apra.gov.au/) statistical publications and return them as a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) object.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub using the [*remotes*](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("javanderwal/readapra")
```

## Features

Currently the `readapra` package only contains functions related to the scraping of Authorised Deposit- taking Institution (ADI) statistical publications produced by APRA. The intention is to have future versions of `readapra` also be able to scrape Insurance and Superannuation statistical publications produced by APRA.

#### ADI statistical publications

The following ADI statistical publications can be scraped using `readapra`:

-   [Quarterly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Performance Statistics (QADIPS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics)

-   [Quarterly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Centralised Publication (QADICP)](https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics)

-   [Quarterly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Property Exposures Statistics (QADIPEXS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics) (Both the current and historic series)

-   [Monthly Authorised Deposit- taking Institution Statistics (MADIS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/monthly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics) (Both the current and historic series)

-   [Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Points of Presence Statistics (ADIPOPS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/authorised-deposit-taking-institutions-points-of-presence-statistics)

## Example

Using the `readapra` package it is extremely easy to download and import APRA's statistical publication data into R. This allows for the easy visualisation of the data using packages such as ggplot2.

```{r library_packages, message = FALSE}
library(readapra)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

First we extract the Monthly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Statistics (MADIS) data using the `read_qadips` function:

```{r get_madis}
madis_data <- read_madis("current")
```

We then clean up the data a bit further using some functions from *dplyr*:

```{r clean_madis}
major_bank_assets <-
  madis_data %>%
  filter(
    abn %in% c(48123123124, 33007457141, 12004044937, 11005357522),
    series == "Total residents assets"
  )
```

And then finally we can plot the data, showing total resident assets for the individual major Australian banks.

```{r plot_madis, dpi=300, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(
  data = major_bank_assets,
  mapping = aes(date, value, colour = institution_name)
) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(ncol = 1))
```

## Managing Network Connections

Corporate networks, especially those using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), may restrict the ability to download files within an R session. A possible fix for this is to utilise the the `"wininet"` method for downloading files. Users can specify the `"wininet"` method (or any other download method) for `readapra` to use by setting the `"R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD"` environment variable. 

To set the `"R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD"` environment variable for your current session, use the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv("R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD" = "wininet")
```

You can add `"R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD" = "wininet"` to your `.Renviron` file to ensure this download setting persists across R sessions. You can conveniently access and edit your `.Renviron` file with the usethis package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
